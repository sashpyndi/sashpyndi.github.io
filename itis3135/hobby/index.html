      <h2>About </h2>
      <p> My name is Sashank Pyndi, and I am currently a sophomore at UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science. Outside of school, one of my favorite hobbies 
          to do is to go and travel mostly inside the United States, and sometimes out of country. My family is originally from India, so I usually make a visit there every five years 
          , and during those vists it opens me up more to the culture, and increses my motivation go go see more places. During the summer of 2016 on the way to India, my family and I make a trip
         to Italy which was one of the best moments in my life.

        <h2>Lovely Moments!</h2>
        <p>In 2016, my family and I visited Italy, which was my favorite traveling experience so far. My Italy vacation really opened me up to the culture there, I got 
            to try some authentic Italian Pizza's and pastas, and also was able to see some amazing landmarks. The cities I visited there were Venice, Rome, and Milan. My favorite
            landmark in Rome Was the Roman Collessum which was a beautiful looking landmark where I got to learn about the gladiator and olympics during those days.

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
            When I travel I enjoy seeing everything and learnign everything in the first hand experience
            and I tend to learn things better than just reading a textbook at school. With that, I really learned a lot of stuff first hand 
           about the gladiator fights and saw the monuments of Venice and rome where the city has origniated from.

        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
         With our Italy trips and many of our trips we got a good deal when going through Italy while traveling 
         to India so we agreed to go with it. It was really worth visiting for that one week as we saw and came across lot of interesting and beautiful place.

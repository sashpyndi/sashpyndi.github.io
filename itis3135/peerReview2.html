   <ul>
      <li>Contrast: The contrast in david's webpage is ok, but at the same time try to make the paragraphs fonts bigger so it can be easier on the eye to read. </li>
      <li>Repetition: The headings are consistent throught the site with the fonts and sizes as consistent. </li>
      <li>Alignment: The alignment on this page with the images and texts being at the right place.  </li>
      <li>Proximity: The promitity is a little bit too close with there not being much space between the image and text in pages like the Honey page</li>

      <li>The pages share the same header and nav bar with the main being pretty consistent throughout the site</li>
   </ul><br>
    

   <p>David has done a pretty good job for the most part. Its just that he needs to further apart his proximity and also make some of the fonts bigger to be able to read</p>

    <p>
       <div>
         I, Sashank S. Pyndi agree to abide by terms of the course contract in my Spring Semester 2022, ITIS, 3135 with my instructor, Professor D.I von Briesen. 
       </div>
       <div>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in  assignments may show as absences.
      </div>
       <div> 
       I also understand that given the structure and content of th this class it's possible to find many examples online or event view my classmates' code directly.  I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where 
       I have proerly given credit(i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.

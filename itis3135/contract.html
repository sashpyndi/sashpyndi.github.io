         <h2>Course Contract</h2>

    <p>
       
        I, <a href = introduction.html> Sashank S. Pyndi</a>  agree to abide by terms of the course contract in my Spring Semester 2022, ITIS, 3135 with my instructor, 
         Professor D.I von Briesen. 
    </p> 
      
      </p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in  
        assignments may show as absences.
      </p>
      
      <p> 
       I also understand that given the structure and content of th this class it's possible to find many examples online or event view my classmates' code directly.  I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where 
       I have properly given credit(i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
      </p>

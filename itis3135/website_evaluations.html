      <br>

      <a href=https://www.tesla.com>
         <h3><strong>TESLA</strong></h3>
      </a>
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong>
            <p>Tesla's website has very good contrast with the opacity of the images of the background
               pictures showing the cars and the scenary representation having an opacity that will clearly show the
               font showing the car names. Also the background
               pictures showing the cars are light color with the text saying the car models as being a black color
               text.</p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> The Repetition on Tesl's website is amazing with it showing the name of the
            cars with the same font and with each name,
            associating a picture of the car with 2 other other buttons that link to the custom order and existing
            inventory.
         </li>

         <li>
            <strong>Alignment: </strong> The element of objects are aligned in a way that is very organized like a grid
            and very easy to see and navigate to the specs of the car and also to the purchasing of the car.
         </li>

         <li>
            <strong>Proximity: </strong> The promity of the webiste icons are very structed to be easy on the eyes with
            the pictures
            layed out well and does not strain your eyes.
         </li>
      </ul>

         <h3><strong>Gatesfences</strong></h3>
      </a>
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> <p>The contrast in this website is terrible with many of the fonts way too small
            with many
            of the fonts small and hard to read and in many places, a light color font is mingling with a light color
            background.
            </p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> Repetition is ok, with font and style, but it would have been better if each
            category of elements
            are have the same font style. For example, the content with one style, and the title with a different style.
         </li>

         <li>
            <strong>Alignment: </strong> Alignment of the certain topics discussed in this webpage is good with it being
            more grid like.
         </li>

         <li>
            <strong>Proximity: </strong> Proximity of this webpage is terrible with there being a lot of images and
            textboxes crammed with each other
            and so its hard to follow.
         </li>
      </ul>
